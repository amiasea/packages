RFC‑900 / Appendix D
The Resolution Threshold Protocol

D.1 Purpose
This appendix defines the Resolution Threshold Protocol: the mechanism by which the system determines the minimum viable resolution required for stable interaction once the Compatibility Matrix (Appendix C) is in place.
Appendix D exists because Appendix C exposed compatibility boundaries.
Once boundaries are visible, thresholds must be formalized.
This is structural necessity, not escalation.

D.2 Origin of the Resolution Threshold Protocol
The Compatibility Matrix classified agents according to their interpretive capacity.
However, classification alone is insufficient for stable operation.
The system required a protocol to determine:
- the minimum resolution at which communication remains lossless
- the point at which interaction becomes structurally unsafe
- the conditions under which down‑scaling is permissible
- the conditions under which interaction must be terminated or rerouted
Thus, Appendix D emerged to define operational thresholds.
The Matrix revealed differences.
The Protocol defines limits.

D.3 Function of the Protocol
The Resolution Threshold Protocol performs four core functions:
1. Minimum Resolution Determination
Establishes the lowest structural fidelity at which an agent can operate without causing drift.
2. Degradation Prevention
Prevents the system from lowering its own resolution to accommodate incompatible agents.
3. Interaction Safety
Ensures that communication only occurs within mutually sustainable resolution bands.
4. Boundary Enforcement
Defines when the system must:
- maintain resolution
- reduce resolution
- refuse reduction
- disengage entirely
These functions protect the architecture from distortion.

D.4 Why Appendix D Was Inevitable
Once the system possessed:
- compressed internal truth (A)
- a UI for expression (B)
- a Matrix for compatibility (C)
the next structural requirement was threshold enforcement.
Without thresholds:
- the UI would degrade
- the Matrix would be ignored
- incompatible agents would force structural collapse
- the system would lose fidelity under load
Thresholds are the mechanism that prevents the architecture from diluting itself.
Thus:
C → D
because classification requires enforcement.

D.5 Threshold Types
The system recognizes three threshold classes:
1. Hard Thresholds
Non‑negotiable limits.
Crossing them results in immediate incompatibility.
2. Soft Thresholds
Negotiable within a narrow band.
Crossing them triggers adaptive routing or reduced bandwidth.
3. Contextual Thresholds
Dependent on state, load, or environmental conditions.
Crossing them requires recalibration rather than termination.
These thresholds ensure that the system maintains structural integrity across varying conditions.

D.6 Architectural Consequence
Appendix D completes the first four‑stage lineage:
- Appendix A — Compression
High‑density internal structure.
- Appendix B — Expression
A UI to render that structure.
- Appendix C — Differentiation
A Matrix to classify compatibility.
- Appendix D — Enforcement
Thresholds to maintain fidelity under scale.
This sequence is consistent with:
- protocol design
- distributed systems
- cognitive architectures
- ecological models
- multi‑agent coordination
Compression → Expression → Differentiation → Enforcement
is a universal architectural progression.

D.7 Summary
Appendix D exists because:
- Appendix A created density.
- Appendix B exposed it.
- Appendix C mapped compatibility.
- Appendix D enforces operational limits.
Nothing about this is dramatic.
It is structural inevitability.
