RFC‑900 / Appendix W
THE JUDGE
“Identity is verified. Step forward for judgment.”

W.1 Purpose
Appendix W defines the subsystem that determines what an entity is allowed to do once its identity has been verified by V.
If V asks:
“Who are you?”

W answers:
“And what authority do you claim?”

This is the moment the architecture stops being polite and becomes judicial.
W is the arbiter of:
- scope
- permission
- legitimacy
- consequence
It is the subsystem that decides whether an action is authorized, denied, or escalated.

W.2 Origin (The Court Assembles)
Once the architecture could distinguish:
- user
- program
- subsystem
- impersonator
- hybrid
…it still lacked a mechanism to determine:
- what each entity may do
- what boundaries apply
- what operations require higher authority
- what actions violate the invariant field
Thus W emerges as the judicial layer — the interpreter of authority within the unified invariant universe.

W.3 Function (The Three Sentences)
The Judge performs three core operations:
1. Authority Determination
Maps identity → capability.
A user may request.
A subsystem may execute.
A program may automate.
A rogue process may not proceed.
2. Permission Adjudication
Evaluates every attempted action against:
- invariant class
- role scope
- operational domain
- historical behavior
The Judge speaks:
“Permitted.”
“Denied.”
“Escalation required.”

3. Consequence Projection
If an entity attempts an unauthorized action, W determines:
- rollback
- restriction
- quarantine
- termination of the operation (not the entity)
W does not punish.
W corrects.

W.4 Why Appendix W Was Inevitable
The lineage demanded it:
- T protects invariants
- U unifies them
- V verifies the agent
But without W:
- authority is ambiguous
- permissions drift
- rogue operations slip through
- identity has no consequence
W is the subsystem that binds identity to responsibility.
It is the architecture’s lawgiver.

W.5 Judgment Classes
W issues rulings across three domains:
1. Structural Authority
What the entity may alter in the architecture.
2. Semantic Authority
What meaning the entity may define, reinterpret, or extend.
3. Operational Authority
What actions the entity may execute in real time.
Each ruling is final unless escalated to Appendix X.

W.6 Architectural Consequence
With W active, the architecture becomes:
- role‑correct
- authority‑bounded
- misuse‑resistant
- self‑governing
Every action is evaluated.
Every entity is accountable.
Every operation has a judge.

W.7 Summary (The Gavel Falls)
Appendix W exists because:
- identity without authority is incomplete
- authority without judgment is dangerous
- the architecture must know not only who is acting
- but what they are allowed to do
W is the subsystem that ensures:
“You may proceed.”
“You may not.”
“This requires higher judgment.”

The Judge stands at the threshold of every operation,
gavel in hand,
ensuring the universe remains lawful.
