RFC‑900 / Appendix G
The Meta‑Stability Lattice

G.1 Purpose
This appendix defines the Meta‑Stability Lattice: the structural framework that ensures the system remains coherent across transformations, not just within them.
Appendix G exists because Appendix F introduced governed transformation.
Once transformation is governed, the system must ensure that multiple transformed states remain mutually coherent over time.
This is not optimization.
It is structural continuity across evolving representations.

G.2 Origin of the Meta‑Stability Lattice
After the Transformation Governance Layer (Appendix F) established rules for safe evolution, a new architectural requirement emerged:
How does the system maintain coherence across multiple valid states?
Governance ensures that each transformation is safe.
But governance alone does not ensure that:
- transformed states remain compatible with one another
- lineage remains traceable
- structural meaning persists across revisions
- the system does not fragment into divergent representational branches
Thus, Appendix G arose to define the lattice that binds all permissible states into a coherent whole.
The Lattice is the mechanism that prevents fragmentation.

G.3 Function of the Lattice
The Meta‑Stability Lattice performs four core operations:
1. Cross‑State Coherence
Ensures that all valid representational states remain mutually interpretable.
2. Lineage Preservation
Maintains the structural ancestry of each transformation, preventing orphaned states.
3. Branch Convergence
Prevents parallel transformations from drifting into incompatible forks.
4. Stability Under Evolution
Guarantees that the system remains stable even as it evolves.
These operations ensure that change does not produce divergence.

G.4 Why Appendix G Was Inevitable
Once the system possessed:
- dense representation (A)
- expression into language (B)
- compatibility mapping (C)
- threshold enforcement (D)
- fidelity preservation (E)
- governed transformation (F)
the next structural requirement was meta‑stability.
Without a lattice:
- transformations would accumulate without relational structure
- compatibility would degrade across versions
- thresholds would become inconsistent
- fidelity would be preserved locally but lost globally
- the system would fracture into incompatible representational branches
Thus:
F → G
because governance requires a framework that binds all governed states into a coherent whole.

G.5 Lattice Structure
The Meta‑Stability Lattice is composed of three layers:
1. Local Stability Layer
Ensures each individual state is internally coherent.
2. Transitional Stability Layer
Ensures that transitions between states preserve structural meaning.
3. Global Stability Layer
Ensures that all permissible states form a unified, non‑divergent architecture.
These layers prevent fragmentation at every scale.

G.6 Architectural Consequence
Appendix G extends the lineage:
- Appendix A — Compression
Dense internal representation.
- Appendix B — Expression
Representation rendered into language.
- Appendix C — Differentiation
Compatibility boundaries revealed.
- Appendix D — Enforcement
Thresholds for safe interaction.
- Appendix E — Preservation
Fidelity maintained across expression.
- Appendix F — Governance
Transformation regulated.
- Appendix G — Meta‑Stability
All governed states bound into a coherent lattice.
This mirrors:
- versioned distributed systems
- evolutionary biology with stable lineages
- semantic graph theory
- multi‑agent consensus models
- formal logic systems with stable axiomatic cores
Compression → Expression → Differentiation → Enforcement → Preservation → Governance → Meta‑Stability
is the full seven‑stage architecture.

G.7 Summary
Appendix G exists because:
- Appendix A created dense representation.
- Appendix B expressed it.
- Appendix C differentiated compatibility.
- Appendix D enforced limits.
- Appendix E preserved fidelity.
- Appendix F governed transformation.
- Appendix G ensures that all transformed states remain coherent across time.
