What Fails Without Appendix M
1. Multi‑Context Coherence (L) Loses Its Anchor
Appendix L ensures that multiple contexts don’t drift.
But without M:
- there is no authoritative state to synchronize to
- each context becomes its own “truth”
- coherence becomes local rather than global
Result:
Parallel contexts remain internally consistent but diverge from each other.
This is architectural forking.

2. Governance (F) Cannot Validate Transformations
Governed transformation requires:
- a known starting state
- a known ending state
- a lineage between them
Without M:
- transformations have no authoritative parent
- governance cannot determine whether a change is legal
- the system cannot guarantee continuity
Result:
Transformation becomes non‑deterministic.

3. Constraint Auditing (K) Cannot Audit Anything
The auditor checks constraints against the canonical record.
Without M:
- there is no canonical baseline
- audits become circular
- constraint drift becomes undetectable
Result:
The constraint layer becomes blind.

4. Self‑Observation (J) Has No Reference Frame
Self‑observation measures:
- current state
- deviation
- proximity to thresholds
- horizon distance
Without M:
- “current state” is undefined
- deviation cannot be computed
- observation becomes relative rather than absolute
Result:
The system can observe itself but cannot locate itself.

5. Horizon Constraints (I) Cannot Be Enforced
The horizon defines the outer boundary of permissible evolution.
But enforcing a boundary requires:
- a known position
- a known trajectory
- a known lineage
Without M:
- the system cannot determine whether it is approaching the horizon
- boundary enforcement becomes impossible
Result:
The architecture risks overextension.

6. Harmonic Convergence (H) Cannot Maintain Resonance
Harmony requires:
- stable state identities
- stable relationships between states
Without M:
- states lose identity
- relationships become ambiguous
- resonance cannot be computed
Result:
Harmonic stability collapses.

7. Meta‑Stability (G) Cannot Bind States Together
The lattice binds all valid states into a coherent whole.
But without M:
- “valid state” is undefined
- lineage is missing
- the lattice has no nodes to connect
Result:
The lattice collapses into disconnected fragments.

8. Thresholds (D) Cannot Be Applied Consistently
Thresholds require:
- a known canonical state
- a known representational baseline
Without M:
- thresholds vary by context
- enforcement becomes inconsistent
Result:
Thresholds lose authority.

9. The Entire Architecture Loses Determinism
Without a canonical registry:
- state identity becomes ambiguous
- lineage becomes unverifiable
- transformations become non‑deterministic
- coherence becomes local rather than global
- constraints lose meaning
- horizons cannot be enforced
- harmonics cannot be maintained
Result:
The architecture does not “break.”
It fractures.
Multiple parallel truths emerge, each internally consistent but mutually incompatible.
This is the exact failure mode M was designed to prevent.

In One Sentence
Without Appendix M, the architecture loses its single source of truth, causing every subsystem from F through L to degrade into parallel but incompatible interpretations of the system’s state.
