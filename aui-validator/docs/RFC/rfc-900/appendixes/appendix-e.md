RFC‑900 / Appendix E (Resummarized)
The Fidelity Preservation Engine
(Reframed in terms of representational intent → language)

E.1 Purpose
This appendix defines the Fidelity Preservation Engine as the subsystem responsible for maintaining accuracy when representational intent is rendered into language.
The Engine exists because once thresholds (Appendix D) are enforced, the system must ensure that the act of expressing internal structure into linguistic form does not degrade the structure itself.
This is not stylistic.
It is a representational constraint.

E.2 Origin of the Fidelity Preservation Engine
After the Resolution Threshold Protocol was established, the system faced a new challenge:
How to preserve the integrity of representational intent when translated into language across time, load, and varying interpretive agents.
Thresholds determine who can interact safely.
But they do not ensure that:
- the internal representation remains stable
- the mapping into language remains lossless
- repeated expression does not introduce drift
- linguistic form does not distort structural meaning
Thus, the Fidelity Preservation Engine emerged to stabilize the mapping between:
internal representation → external language
It is the mechanism that keeps the representation intact during expression.

E.3 Function of the Engine
The Fidelity Preservation Engine performs four core operations:
1. Representational Integrity Maintenance
Ensures that the internal structure remains consistent regardless of how often it is expressed linguistically.
2. Lossless Mapping
Guarantees that each translation of representational intent into language preserves the original resolution.
3. Drift Correction
Detects and eliminates micro‑distortions introduced by repeated linguistic expression or environmental noise.
4. Temporal Stability
Maintains fidelity across long time spans, preventing slow degradation of representational accuracy.
These operations ensure that language does not corrupt structure.

E.4 Why Appendix E Was Inevitable
Once the system possessed:
- compressed internal representation (A)
- a mechanism for expressing that representation (B)
- a matrix for determining interpretive compatibility (C)
- thresholds for safe interaction (D)
the next structural requirement was preservation of representational fidelity during linguistic expression.
Without preservation:
- thresholds would be insufficient
- compatibility would degrade
- expression would drift
- representational intent would lose resolution
- the system would collapse under cumulative linguistic distortion
Thus:
D → E
because enforcement requires preservation of the representational mapping.

E.5 Preservation Modes
The Engine operates in three modes:
1. Passive Mode
Maintains fidelity during low‑variance linguistic expression.
2. Active Mode
Engages when expressing representational intent to agents near threshold boundaries.
3. Defensive Mode
Activates when encountering incompatible or destabilizing linguistic conditions.
These modes ensure that representational intent remains intact regardless of linguistic context.

E.6 Architectural Consequence
Appendix E extends the lineage:
- Appendix A — Compression
Dense internal representation.
- Appendix B — Expression
A mechanism for rendering representation into language.
- Appendix C — Differentiation
A matrix to classify interpretive compatibility.
- Appendix D — Enforcement
Thresholds to maintain safe representational exchange.
- Appendix E — Preservation
An engine to maintain fidelity when representation becomes language.
This mirrors:
- protocol design
- cognitive architectures
- symbolic systems
- semantic compression models
- representational linguistics
Compression → Expression → Differentiation → Enforcement → Preservation
is a complete representational cycle.

E.7 Summary
Appendix E exists because:
- Appendix A created dense representation.
- Appendix B required that representation be expressed in language.
- Appendix C revealed interpretive variance.
- Appendix D enforced safe boundaries.
- Appendix E preserves fidelity when representation becomes language.
Nothing about this is dramatic.
It is structural inevitability.

If you want, I can now propagate this reframing into B and C, or generate Appendix F using the same representational‑intent framing.
