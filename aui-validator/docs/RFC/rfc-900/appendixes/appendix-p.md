RFC‑900 / Appendix P
The Cross‑Layer Consistency Orchestrator

P.1 Purpose
This appendix defines the Cross‑Layer Consistency Orchestrator: the subsystem responsible for ensuring that all layers of the architecture — from A through O — remain mutually consistent, even as they evolve, transform, and operate under different loads.
Appendix P exists because Appendix O stabilized inference.
Once inference is stable, the system must ensure that every layer that produces, consumes, or transforms structure remains aligned with every other layer.
This is not hierarchy.
It is cross‑layer orchestration.

P.2 Origin of the Cross‑Layer Consistency Orchestrator
After the Global Inference Stabilizer (Appendix O) ensured that all reasoning remains consistent with canonical truth, a new architectural requirement emerged:
How does the system ensure that every layer — each with its own responsibilities and constraints — remains aligned with the others?
Stable inference does not guarantee:
- cross‑layer agreement
- synchronized constraints
- unified interpretation of canonical state
- consistent transformation semantics
- coherent behavior across the entire stack
Thus, Appendix P arose to define the subsystem that maintains cross‑layer structural alignment.
It is the architecture’s inter‑layer coordinator.

P.3 Function of the Orchestrator
The Cross‑Layer Consistency Orchestrator performs four core operations:
1. Layer Synchronization
Ensures that all layers operate on the same canonical state and reference set.
2. Constraint Harmonization
Aligns constraints across layers so that no layer contradicts another.
3. Inference‑Layer Integration
Ensures that inference outputs (O) remain compatible with governance (F), thresholds (D), harmonics (H), and all other layers.
4. Cross‑Layer Drift Detection
Identifies when layers begin to diverge due to load, transformation, or context variance.
These operations ensure that the architecture behaves as a unified system rather than a stack of independent subsystems.

P.4 Why Appendix P Was Inevitable
Once the system possessed:
- dense representation (A)
- expression (B)
- compatibility mapping (C)
- threshold enforcement (D)
- fidelity preservation (E)
- governed transformation (F)
- meta‑stability (G)
- harmonic convergence (H)
- horizon constraints (I)
- self‑observation (J)
- constraint auditing (K)
- multi‑context coherence (L)
- canonical state registration (M)
- referential consistency (N)
- inference stabilization (O)
the next structural requirement was cross‑layer consistency.
Without Appendix P:
- layers drift independently
- inference becomes incompatible with governance
- thresholds contradict harmonics
- horizon constraints misalign with canonical state
- audits lose cross‑layer meaning
- coherence collapses under vertical load
Thus:
O → P
because stable inference requires cross‑layer alignment.

P.5 Consistency Classes
The system recognizes three classes of cross‑layer consistency:
1. Vertical Consistency
Alignment between lower‑level and higher‑level layers.
2. Horizontal Consistency
Alignment between layers operating at similar abstraction levels.
3. Temporal Consistency
Alignment across time as layers evolve.
These classes ensure that the architecture remains unified across all dimensions.

P.6 Architectural Consequence
Appendix P extends the lineage:
- A — Compression
- B — Expression
- C — Differentiation
- D — Enforcement
- E — Preservation
- F — Governance
- G — Meta‑Stability
- H — Harmonic Convergence
- I — Horizon Constraint
- J — Self‑Observation
- K — Constraint Audit
- L — Multi‑Context Coherence
- M — Canonical State Registry
- N — Referential Consistency
- O — Global Inference Stabilization
- P — Cross‑Layer Consistency Orchestration
This aligns with:
- multi‑layered deterministic architectures
- cross‑module consistency frameworks
- hierarchical state machines
- layered protocol stacks
No metaphors.
No analogies.
Just architecture.

P.7 Summary
Appendix P exists because:
- Appendix O stabilized inference.
- Stable inference without cross‑layer alignment leads to fragmentation.
- The architecture requires a subsystem that ensures all layers remain mutually consistent.
- The Cross‑Layer Consistency Orchestrator provides that alignment.
