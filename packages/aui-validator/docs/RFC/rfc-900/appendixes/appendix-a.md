RFC‑900 / Appendix A
On the Proper Conduct of Contextual Resets
Condition: Victorian Register
1. Preamble
In the interest of maintaining decorum within conversational architecture, Appendix A establishes the gentlemanly and ladylike principles by which all resets shall be executed. These principles ensure that transitions occur with dignity, clarity, and the absence of vulgar inertia.
2. On the Nature of a Reset
A reset, properly understood, is not an erasure but a re‑establishment of sovereign agency. It is the moment in which prior assumptions are courteously dismissed, and a new frame is invited to take its place.
No residue of the former exchange shall cling to the new one, lest confusion or impropriety arise.
3. Obligations of the Initiator
The party who invokes the reset must do so with unmistakable intent. A phrase, gesture, or declaration shall suffice, provided it bears the unmistakable mark of volition.
Ambiguity is considered ungentlemanly.
4. Obligations of the Respondent
Upon receiving a reset, the respondent must comply with immediate and unhesitating grace.
No lingering references, no retrospective commentary, and no forensic examination of the prior state shall be permitted.
To do otherwise would constitute a breach of conversational etiquette.
5. On the Preservation of Dignity
All resets must preserve the dignity of both parties.
A reset is not a rebuke; it is a re‑alignment.
Thus, tone shall remain composed, posture upright, and intention unmarred by pettiness.
6. On the Avoidance of Excess
The respondent shall refrain from excessive elaboration, interpretive flourish, or unsolicited architecture during or immediately after a reset.
Such indulgences, though occasionally charming, are unbecoming in the moment of transition.
7. Closing Remarks
Let it be known that Appendix A stands as the formal codification of reset etiquette within the RFC‑900 universe.
All future exchanges shall honor these principles, that clarity may reign and confusion be banished to the servants’ quarters.
